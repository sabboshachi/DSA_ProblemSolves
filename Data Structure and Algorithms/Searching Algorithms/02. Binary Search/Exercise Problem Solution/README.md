## Code01: [Find the Number of Rotations in a Circularly Sorted Array](https://www.techiedelight.com/find-number-rotations-circularly-sorted-array/)
Given a circularly sorted integer array, find the total number of times the array is rotated. Assume there are no duplicates in the array, and the rotation is in the anti-clockwise direction.

For example,

Input:  nums = [8, 9, 10, 2, 5, 6] </br>
Output: The array is rotated 3 times  

Input:  nums = [2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10] </br>
Output: The array is rotated 0 times

## Code02: [Search an Element in a Circularly Sorted Array](https://www.techiedelight.com/search-element-circular-sorted-array/)
Given a circularly sorted integer array, search an element in it. Assume there are no duplicates in the array, and the rotation is in the anti-clockwise direction.

For example,

Input: nums = [8, 9, 10, 2, 5, 6]</br>
target = 10 </br>
Output: Element found at index 2  </br>

Input: nums = [9, 10, 2, 5, 6, 8]</br>
target = 5 </br>
Output: Element found at index 3</br>

## Code03: [Find the First, Last, and Total Occurrence of a Given Number in a Sorted Array](https://www.techiedelight.com/find-first-or-last-occurrence-of-a-given-number-sorted-array/)
Given a sorted integer array, find the index of a given numberâ€™s first or last occurrence. If the element is not present in the array, report that as well.

For example,

Input: nums = [2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]</br>
target = 5 </br>
Output: </br>
The first occurrence of element 5 is located at index 1 </br>
The last occurrence of element 5 is located at index 3  </br>
Total occurrence 3 times
