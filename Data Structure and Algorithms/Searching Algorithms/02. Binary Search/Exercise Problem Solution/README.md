## Code01: Find the Number of Rotations in a Circularly Sorted Array [Link](https://www.techiedelight.com/find-number-rotations-circularly-sorted-array/)
Given a circularly sorted integer array, find the total number of times the array is rotated. Assume there are no duplicates in the array, and the rotation is in the anti-clockwise direction.

For example,

Input:  nums = [8, 9, 10, 2, 5, 6]
Output: The array is rotated 3 times  

Input:  nums = [2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
Output: The array is rotated 0 times
