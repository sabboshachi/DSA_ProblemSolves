# ProblemSolving_GfG üöÄ  

This folder is a curated collection of C/C++ problems I have solved, categorized into different sections for easy navigation. I understand each problem, I tried to give a detailed explanation for each solution.  

The problems have been sourced from the [**GeeksforGeeks**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cc-programs/) website, which is renowned for its comprehensive and diverse collection of coding challenges.  

## üåü Objectives  
- To document and share my journey of solving C/C++ problems.  
- To provide clear and detailed explanations of problem solutions for learners and enthusiasts.  
- To create a categorized resource for quick reference and learning.  

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure  

The problems are categorized into the following sections:  

1. **sArray C/C++ Programs**    
2. **Matrix C/C++ Programs**   
3. **String C/C++ Programs**    
4. **Linked List C/C++ Programs**    
5. **Stack C/C++ Programs**   
6. **Queue C/C++ Programs**  
7. **Tree C/C++ Programs**  
8. **Graph C/C++ Programs**  
9. **Bit-Magic C/C++ Program**  
10. **C/C++ Mathematical Programs**  
11. **C/C++ Dynamic Programming Programs**  
12. **C/C++ Greedy Algorithm Programs**
