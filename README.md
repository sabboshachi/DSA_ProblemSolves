# DataStructure & Algorithm 

In this repository I'm trying to solve and practice the very basic of data structure and algorithm. It is one of the most important and must read topic for any CS student. Here I'll try to cover it using two or three different programing languages such as Java and Python. 
I've taken instruction from different sources which I'll update with time.

Currently, I'm following the book 
### "SCHAUM'S OUTLINE SERIES THEORY AND PROBLEMS OF DATA STRUCTURE"

The book can be downloaded from here: [BOOK](https://#)
